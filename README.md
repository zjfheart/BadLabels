# BadLabels
The code repository for a challenging label noise called ***BadLabels*** and a robust noisy-label learning algorithm called ***Robust DivideMix***.

## Prerequisites
Python (3.8)  
Pytorch (1.8.0)  
CUDA  
Numpy  

## Usage
### Generate BadLabels
You can run the following command to synthesize BadLabels.
```
cd gen_badlabels
./gen_badlabels.sh
```

### Evaluate BadLabels
Run the following command to evaluate BadLabels on various LNL algorithms.
```
cd eval_badlabels
./eval_badlabels.sh
```

### Evaluate Robust DivideMix
Run the following command to evaluate Robust DivideMix on different datasets.
```
cd robust_LNL_algo
./eval_robust_dividemix.sh
```

## Generated Label Noise & Datasets
We have shared various label noises generated by us under the ***eval_badlabels / noise*** directory for quick experimental verification.

If you want to quickly evaluate BadLabels on your own algorithm, we also provide MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 training sets with injected BadLabels in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZGA2_KzYK8KCl89Zko4ahjnAk6s9K3pX?usp=sharing). You can easily load the datasets and train using ***load_badlabels_dataset.py*** under the ***eval_badlabels*** directory.
